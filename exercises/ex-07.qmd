title: "Ex-07: Model Evaluation with Classification"
---

## Objective:

Use a pre-trained decision tree classifier on the loans dataset to calculate precision, recall, and the F1 score for its predictions. This exercise will help you understand how to evaluate a model's performance beyond simple accuracy, especially in the context of imbalanced datasets.

## Setup:

1.  Ensure that you have access to a Python environment with the required libraries installed (**{pandas}**, **{numpy}**, **{scikit-learn}**, **{matplotlib}**, **{seaborn}**).

2.  Access the dataset (**`loans_class.csv`**) and follow the pre-processing steps from the lecture content (or below) to prepare the data for modeling.

3.  The decision tree model has already been trained on the dataset. Provide students with the model's predictions on the test set.
