The dataset `taylor_album_songs.csv` should be available in the **`data`** directory.\n\n## Dataset:\n\nSince [The Eras Tour Film](https://www.tstheerastourfilm.com/) was just released, this week we're exploring Taylor Swift song data!\n\nAre you Ready for It?\n\nThe [taylor](https://taylor.wjakethompson.com/) R package from W. Jake Thompson is a curated data set of Taylor Swift songs, including lyrics and audio characteristics. The data comes from Genius and the Spotify API.\n\nThere are three main datasets.\n\n> The first is taylor_album_songs, which includes lyrics and audio features from the Spotify API for all songs on Taylor's official studio albums. Notably this excludes singles released separately from an album (e.g., Only the Young, Christmas Tree Farm, etc.), and non-Taylor-owned albums that have a Taylor-owned alternative (e.g., Fearless is excluded in favor of Fearless (Taylor's Version)). We stan artists owning their own songs.\n\n> You can access Taylor's entire discography with taylor_all_songs. This includes all of the songs in taylor_album_songs plus EPs, individual singles, and the original versions of albums that have been re-released as Taylor's Version.\n\n> Finally, there is a small data set, taylor_albums, summarizing Taylor's album release history.\n\nInformation on the audio features in the dataset from Spotify are included in their [API documentation](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/get-audio-features).\n\nFor your visualizations, the {taylor} package comes with it's own class of color palettes, inspired by the work of Josiah Parry in the [{cpcinema}](https://github.com/JosiahParry/cpcinema) package.\n\nYou might also be interested in the [tayoRswift package](https://asteves.github.io/tayloRswift/) by Alex Stephenson, a ggplot2 color palette based on Taylor Swift album covers. \"For when your colors absolutely should not be excluded from the narrative.\"\n\n### Metadata for ```

The overall loudness of a track in decibels (dB). Loudness values are averaged across the entire track.                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n| `mode`                | integer   | Mode indicates the modality (major or minor) of a track, the type of scale from which its melodic content is derived. Major is represented by 1 and minor is 0.                                                                                                                                                 |\n| `speechiness`         | double    | Spotify speechiness score. Speechiness detects the presence of spoken words in a track. The more exclusively speech-like the recording (e.g. talk show, audio book, poetry), the closer to 1.0 the attribute value.                                                                                             |\n| `acousticness`        | double    | Spotify acousticness score. A confidence measure from 0.0 to 1.0 of whether the track is acoustic. 1.0 represents high confidence the track is acoustic.                                                                                                                                                        |\n| `instrumentalness`    | double    | Spotify instrumentalness score. Predicts whether a track contains no vocals. The closer the instrumentalness value is to 1.0, the greater likelihood the track contains no vocal content. Values above 0.5 are intended to represent instrumental tracks, but confidence is higher as the value approaches 1.0. |\n| `liveness`            | double    | Spotify liveness score. Detects the presence of an audience in the recording. Higher liveness values represent an increased probability that the track was performed live. A value above 0.8 provides strong likelihood that the track is live.                                                                 |\n| `valence`             | double    | Spotify valence score. A measure from 0.0 to 1.0 describing the musical positiveness conveyed by a track. Tracks with high valence sound more positive (e.g. happy, cheerful, euphoric), while tracks with low valence sound more negative (e.g. sad, depressed, angry).                                        |\n| `tempo`               | double    | The overall estimated tempo of a track in beats per minute (BPM). In musical terminology, tempo is the speed or pace of a given piece and derives directly from the average beat duration.                                                                                                                      |\n| `time_signature`      | integer   | An estimated time signature. The time signature (meter) is a notational convention to specify how many beats are in each bar (or measure).

Load the dataset using **`pandas`**.\n\n2.  Select relevant features for clustering (**`danceability`**, **`energy`**, **`loudness`**, **`speechiness`**, **`acousticness`**, **`instrumentalness`**, **`liveness`**, **`valence`**, **`tempo`**).\n\n3.  Normalize the selected features to have the same scale.\n\n## **Step 2:** Implement Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)\n\n1.  Import **`GaussianMixture`** from **`sklearn.mixture`**.\n\n2.  Determine the optimal number of components (clusters) using a criterion like the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) or Akaike Information Criterion (AIC).\n\n3.  Fit the GMM to the data.\n\n## **Step 3:** Analysis and Visualization\n\n1.  Predict the soft assignments of the samples to the clusters.\n\n2.  Visualize the clusters using a dimensionality reduction technique like PCA (Principal Component Analysis) to reduce the data to two dimensions for plotting.\n\n3.  Analyze the characteristics of each cluster by examining the cluster centers.\n\n## **Step 4:** Discussion\n\n1.  Discuss the interpretation of each cluster based on their centroids.\n\n2.  Explore how different numbers of clusters affect the BIC/AIC and the cluster interpretation.\n\n3.  Consider the implications of soft clustering vs. hard clustering in the context of music tracks.\n\n## **Submission:**\n\n-   Submit your Jupyter Notebook via the course's learning management system, including your code, visualizations, and a brief discussion of your findings regarding the clustering analysis of Taylor Swift songs.\n\n",
