## Getting Started with Homework in Codespaces

This guide walks you through using GitHub Codespaces to complete and submit your homework assignments using Jupyter notebooks. Everything runs in the cloud‚Äîno need to install anything locally!

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 1. Launching a Codespace

1.  Visit your GitHub homework repository.
2.  Click the green **Code** button ‚Üí **Codespaces**.
3.  If none exists, click **Create codespace on main**.
4.  Wait for it to finish setting up (usually 1‚Äì2 minutes).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 2. Opening Your Notebook

1.  In the left **Explorer** pane, find your assignment file (e.g., `release/hw-01.ipynb`).
2.  Click to open it. It will launch in a Jupyter interface directly inside Codespaces.
3.  Click the **‚ñ∂ Run Cell** button or use **Run All** from the top menu.

> ‚úÖ **Reminder:** Answer all parts of the question and run each code cell before submission.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 3. Saving Your Work

Your notebook saves automatically, but you still need to **commit** your changes to submit:

1.  **Stage your work**: \`\`\`bash git add .

2.  **Commit with a message**:

    ``` bash
    git commit -m "Completed Homework 1"
    ```

3.  **Push to GitHub**:

    ``` bash
    git push origin main
    ```

> üö® **Important:** Your instructor will only see work that is pushed to GitHub.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 4. Submission & Autograding

-   Autograding runs automatically every time you push to GitHub.
-   You‚Äôll receive feedback as a GitHub Issue in your repository titled **‚ÄúHomework X Feedback‚Äù**.
-   **Deadlines are enforced**: If you push after the due time, your score may be penalized.

> ‚è∞ **Tip:** Push before the deadline to avoid any late penalties. Only the latest commit before the deadline counts as "on time."

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 5. Shutting Down Safely

-   When you're done, click the green **Codespaces** icon in the lower-left ‚Üí **Stop Codespace**.
-   To return later, go back to the **Codespaces** tab on GitHub and reopen your environment.
